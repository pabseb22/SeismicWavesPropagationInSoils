Tools for homogenizing heterogeneous soil layers and verifying seismic response similarity.

Repository Description:
Project Title: Homogenization of Heterogeneous Soil Strata for Seismic Wave Propagation

Description:
This repository contains a set of tools and scripts for the homogenization of a heterogeneous soil stratum and the propagation of seismic waves through it. The primary goal of this project is to achieve the homogenization of a heterogeneous soil stratum and apply seismic loads to verify the accuracy of the process. We aim to obtain the same acceleration spectrum for both the original and homogenized models, thereby enhancing the understanding and prediction of seismic behavior in various engineering applications.

Objectives:

Homogenize a heterogeneous soil stratum.
Apply seismic loads to verify the accuracy of homogenization.
Obtain the same acceleration spectrum for both models.
Key Features:

Scripts and tools for soil stratum homogenization.
Seismic load simulations and result analysis.
Detailed documentation and usage examples.
Contributions and collaborations are welcome.
Join us in advancing the understanding and application of homogenization of heterogeneous soil strata in seismic engineering projects!
